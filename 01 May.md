 # Lesson 1  A private conversation 
*01*  

>Yesterday evening, my colleague went to a theatre to watch a wonderful show. The show was really wonderful and the seat was great, but he didn't really enjoy it. There was an annoying couple behind him keeping talking loudly, my colleague couldn't even hear the words of the actors. He turned around to have a stare at them, but it didn't work. The couple was just talking and laughing loudly, as if the theatre was an empty park. At last, my colleague couldn't bear it,  turned around, speaked in a politely way:"could you keep silent, i can't hear the words of the actors".

A young man and a young woman sitted behind him, and they kept talking loudly, Comey couldn't hear the actors, so he turned around and look at them angrily, but it didn't work. At last, comey couldn't bear it and turned around again and shouted them, "would you please shut the fuck up, you morons". And some people around the yound couple applaused for him, "yes, keep them shut the fuck up".

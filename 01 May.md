*01*  

>Yesterday evening, my colleague went to a theatre to watch a wonderful show. The show was really wonderful and the seat was great, but he didn't really enjoy it. There was an annoying couple behind him keeping talking loudly, my colleague couldn't even hear the words of the actors. He turned around to have a stare at them, but it didn't work. The couple was just talking and laughing loudly, as if the theatre was an empty park. At last, my colleague couldn't bear it,  turned around, speaked in a politely way:"could you keep silent, i can't hear the words of the actors".

# Lesson 2 Breakfast or lunch?

*01*

> I was in a train to London on a Sunday afternoon, and the time was one o'clock. I was going to see my dear nephew Jude. Jude is a lovely but really lazy boy, he never gets up early in the morning, so no breakfast in his life but always brunch or just lunch.  I saw the time was just fine and called him. He answered in the phone, I told him I was just going to see him and would arrive at the station in about ten minutes. Jude was a little surprised,  he said," but I'm having my breakfast aunt".
>
> I was shocked,"what? pardon?" I couldn't believe he was just having his breakfast.
>
> My nephew repeated his words,"I'm still having my breakfast". He maybe not noticed what time it was. He told me in the phone,"and the weather sucks, it would rain in some time, don't you think so aunt?"
>
> I just laughed,"oh, my baby nephew, it is one o'clock now. you really get up too late this time".

 # Lesson 1  A private conversation 
*01*  

>Yesterday evening, my colleague went to a theatre to watch a wonderful show. The show was really wonderful and the seat was great, but he didn't really enjoy it. There was an annoying couple behind him keeping talking loudly, my colleague couldn't even hear the words of the actors. He turned around to have a stare at them, but it didn't work. The couple was just talking and laughing loudly, as if the theatre was an empty park. At last, my colleague couldn't bear it,  turned around, speaked in a politely way:"could you keep silent, i can't hear the words of the actors".  

> The mad man was irritated, and shouted back in a red face, "it's none of your business, this is an private conversation, okay!"

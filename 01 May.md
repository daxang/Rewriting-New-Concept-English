One day, a huge plane was landing on the airport, the noise was so big that I wondered the house would be knocked down. Next week, I left the house and moved to a much more silent place.

*02*
> Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. I live near an airport and passing planes can be heard night and day. The airport was built years ago, for some reasons, it could not be used then. Last year, however, it came into use. Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their homes by the noise. I am one of the few people left. Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane. I have been received a great sum of money to go away, but I  am determined to stay here. Everybody says I must be mad and they are probably right.

# Lesson 22 A glass envelope
*01*
>I am jane and I live in Boston. Last year, I went to Holland for a travel with my parents. Walking and driving through the Channel was such wonderful experience. Last day, I wrote my name and my address on a paper and then put it into a bottle. The bottle was thrown into the sea by my father. We then got back to Boston. I never dreamed of receiving a letter from Holland. Ten months later, a cute postman called at our house and gave me a letter. It was totally a surprise. The letter was from a girl who got my bottle in Holland . With no doubt, we started our friendship by writting to each other frequently. Why we decide to use a post office, because although letters cost a bit more, but they will certainly travel faster.
